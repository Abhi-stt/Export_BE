   - Can create new orders, view all assignments, manage sub-forwarders

2. **Test as Sub-Forwarder:**

## Troubleshooting

**Q: I forgot a sub-forwarder's password**
A: The Forwarder Admin needs to create a new account or contact system admin for password reset

**Q: Sub-forwarder sees full dashboard instead of "My Tasks"**
A: Check the user's designation - it should NOT include "admin" (case-insensitive)

**Q: Can't create new forwarder - "User already exists"**
A: Email addresses must be unique. Use a different email or delete the existing user first
